At my workplace, AMBOSS, I lead a team of people that write software and I try to help them achieve what they want in life.
I chose to work for AMBOSS to improve healthcare around the world. In my free time I love to mentor and coach people.
I am a fan of writing, the DevOps mentality, and all kinds of games. Mostly I play video games, but when I get the chance I love to play board games and table-top roleplaying games.
Bouldering is a sport that really speaks to me, as it has so much problem-solving.
